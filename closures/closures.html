<div>
    A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s
    variables—scope chain. The closure has three scope chains:

        it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets),
        it has access to the outer function’s variables,
        and it has access to the global variables.

</div>

    <b>Closures have access to the outer function’s variable even after the outer function returns:</b>

    <b>Closures store references to the outer function’s variables;</b>

    they do not store the actual value.
    Closures get more interesting when the value of the outer function’s variable
    changes before the closure is called. And this powerful feature can be harnessed
    in creative ways, such as this private variables example first demonstrated by
    Douglas Crockford:
